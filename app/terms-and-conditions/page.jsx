						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Our terms and conditions become legally binding and
							enforceable upon the registration of an account by
							the Player, any user of JollyLotto.com, who accepts
							all the terms and conditions set herein.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							All prices and balances reflected on JollyLotto are
							in Euros (€).
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							These terms and conditions may be amended from time
							to time, and a Player's continued use of our service
							constitutes consent to these terms and conditions
							and any amendments made by JollyLotto.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Only persons over the age of 18 years are eligible
							to play any of the lotteries or raffles on offer or
							claim any winnings resulting from their ticket
							entries.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto provides a messenger service for the
							purchasing, storing, and handling of official
							lottery ticket entries.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto does not offer any type of lottery or
							gambling products; the entries represent tickets
							purchased for participation in the official
							lotteries organised and managed by the lottery
							operators and not by JollyLotto.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto, its officers, directors, employees,
							agents, and affiliates, will not be liable for any
							loss or damage, direct or consequential, arising
							from content published by third-party advertisers
							and marketers.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							A Player must register and create a JollyLotto
							account before their first purchase by providing
							JollyLotto with their correct personal information,
							which is required to ensure there are no delays with
							the purchases of their ticket entries and processing
							of winnings claims.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Certain country and territory restrictions are
							listed on our FAQ page. Residents of these
							restricted regions will not be able to create an
							account. Registered players who subsequently move to
							one of these restricted regions will no longer be
							able to make payments or process winnings claims.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Once a Player account has been created, the Player
							agrees to be held strictly liable for any activities
							linked to their Player account. Any suspected breach
							of a Player account must be reported to JollyLotto
							as soon as the Player suspects or becomes aware of
							that breach.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Only one account per Player is permitted. JollyLotto
							reserves the right to disable, ban or remove
							accounts that are deemed to be duplicated.
							JollyLotto further reserves the right to ban and/or
							suspend any Player that displays any intention of
							duplicating their account or abusing registration
							services in any way. This includes any attempt to
							circumvent the regional restrictions on accounts.
							Any winnings derived from these accounts will remain
							the property of JollyLotto and/or its agents.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							A Player account will be considered dormant if there
							is no activity on the account for a period of 365
							consecutive days. A dormant account will be charged
							an administration fee of €10 at the end of every
							calendar month for as long as it remains dormant or
							until all Winnings and/or Account balances reach
							zero. A dormant account cannot go into negative
							balance, nor will any registered payment methods
							ever be charged to pay administration fees. Any
							account activity will reactivate the account and
							cancel the fee for that calendar month. Any
							administration fees that have already been charged
							are non-refundable.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							The ticket entries are chosen by the Player on
							JollyLotto.com; including future dated entries and
							purchased subject to the rules and procedures of the
							relevant lotteries entered.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto cannot purchase any further ticket
							entries for the specific draw after the lottery
							draw's specific cut-off time. The Website
							automatically changes over to the next available
							draw date at this cut-off time. Each lottery has its
							own countdown to the cut-off times on JollyLotto
							showing the remaining time to purchase tickets for
							the next draw.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							A confirmation of a Player's purchase will be
							emailed to the Player after their purchase has been
							confirmed and the official lottery tickets purchased
							will dictate the claim. In the event that the Player
							does not receive a confirmation of purchase, the
							onus is on the Player to contact JollyLotto via
							email to immediately report this.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Digitally scanned copies of official lottery tickets
							purchased on behalf of a player are provided on a
							best-efforts basis. At times of extremely high sales
							volumes, it may not be possible to provide a scanned
							copy of the ticket. Where possible, when a scan
							cannot be provided, players will be notified prior
							to purchase. Where scans of official lottery tickets
							are offered, these are made available to a player
							within their secure account. Scans will not be sent
							as an email attachment.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto does not accept any responsibility for
							errors made by the Player when instructing a ticket
							entry purchase. The onus is on the Player to ensure
							that numbers and details provided are correct.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Once a Player has commenced the purchase of tickets
							entries, JollyLotto is unable to offer any refunds,
							and ticket entries cannot be amended or cancelled.
							Players must carefully check their numbers before
							completing their purchase to avoid any errors.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto may at its discretion offer new players a
							Welcome Bonus. If the Welcome Bonus promotion is
							available, this will be clearly noted on the home
							page and on other locations on the site.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							If the Welcome Bonus promotion is active when a
							Player makes their first purchase, they will receive
							a Welcome Bonus amount, which are funds added to the
							Player's Rewards Balance that match a Player's first
							purchase up to an amount not exceeding €50 (Fifty
							Euros). The Welcome Bonus is a one-off introductory
							offer for first-time purchases only and cannot be
							awarded on subsequent purchases even if the initial
							purchase is an amount less than €50.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							When a player qualifies for a Welcome Bonus
							promotion, the Welcome Bonus will immediately
							reflect in a Player's Rewards Balance after their
							first purchase and may be used to make future
							purchases. Any winnings resulting from purchases
							made using the Welcome Bonus funds will be treated
							as normal winnings and can be claimed in line with
							the existing winnings claims conditions.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							For your reference, all credit card payments will
							result in a payment descriptor displayed on the
							order confirmation page/order confirmation email.
							The descriptors at this time can include
							"Company*JOLLYLOTTO" and "JOLLYLOTTO.COM" but may
							change from time to time.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							All payments are immediately debited with the value
							of the transaction, and in the event of fraudulent
							activity with the payment will result in the tickets
							purchased becoming the property of JollyLotto and
							any winnings that are derived therefrom will remain
							the property of JollyLotto and/or its agents.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto reserves the right to cancel any
							transaction that appears to be of a fraudulent
							nature, and the account of the Player in question
							may be suspended.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto can only conclude a playing agreement
							with Players who are lawfully entitled in their
							prevailing jurisdiction to participate in the
							services offered by JollyLotto.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Any playing agreement concluded with a Player who is
							not entitled to participate in the services offered
							by JollyLotto may be cancelled, suspended, revoked,
							forfeited, or enforced at the exclusive election of
							JollyLotto.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto, its officers, directors, employees,
							agents, and affiliates, accepts no responsibility
							and is expressly indemnified from any and all
							actions of any Player who participates in the
							services offered by JollyLotto when that Player is
							prohibited from doing so by the laws prevailing over
							that Player.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							At all material times the onus rests on the Player
							to ensure that any law applicable and governing
							their conduct does not prohibit them from concluding
							a playing agreement or participating in the services
							offered by JollyLotto. It is the Player's exclusive
							responsibility to ensure that any changes to the
							laws governing their transactions do not affect
							their ability to participate in the services offered
							by JollyLotto.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto, its officers, directors, employees,
							agents, and affiliates, does not accept liability of
							any kind in case of non-acceptance of the offer of
							the Player by the respective lottery operator.
							Furthermore, JollyLotto, its officers, directors,
							employees, agents, and affiliates, does not accept
							liability of any kind for mistakes in the area of
							the respective lottery operator.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							The fees charged by JollyLotto to the Player include
							the cost price of the lottery tickets and the
							service fees arising from the messenger services
							provided by JollyLotto's agents.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Only the prices quoted at the time of the selection
							of ticket entries by the Players are valid.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Players acknowledge that they may be responsible for
							the payment of their local taxes in respect of any
							winnings. It remains the Player's sole
							responsibility to report any taxable winnings to
							their local tax authorities.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							For smaller winnings, the amount won will reflect in
							a winning Player's Winning Balance as soon as the
							ticket numbers have been confirmed by our agents.
							The amount that is reflected will, where applicable,
							be shown less any taxes or other fees that would
							ordinarily be deducted from the total winnings
							amount, in accordance with rules and procedures of
							the relevant lottery operator.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							For larger winnings, JollyLotto will contact the
							winning Player to arrange for that Player to collect
							their winnings. Any third-party costs associated
							with the collection and transfer of winnings remain
							solely the responsibility of the winning Player.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Winnings reflected in a Player's Winnings Balance
							can be accessed when a Player uses the 'claim
							winnings' option on the Claim page and follows the
							resulting claims process. A minimum claim amount
							shall apply. The Player is responsible for any fees
							arising from the processing of said claim.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							JollyLotto adheres to Anti-Money Laundering
							principles. As part of the claims process, a Player
							may be required to show some or all of the following
							proofs of identity and address: A colour photo or
							scan of the Player's government-issued photo ID
							(such as a passport, driving licence, or ID card); A
							copy of a recent (past 3 months) utility bill; A
							recent credit card statement.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							A Player's account contains 3 (three) balances
							reflecting funds. Each balance has been allocated a
							specific purpose as set out below:
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Account Balance is used by the Player to deposit
							funds into and to be used to make purchases of
							ticket entries on JollyLotto. Winnings Balance is
							used by JollyLotto to reflect any winnings to be
							processed by our agents as a result of a Player's
							ticket entries. Rewards Balance is used by
							JollyLotto to credit the Player with their welcome
							bonus and any other promotional funds such as
							cashback received from the loyalty program and/or
							other account credits issued by JollyLotto. Any
							rewards balance in a Player's account will expire if
							a Player has not made a purchase for more than 60
							days. Provided the Player makes a purchase within
							the 60 days, the full rewards balance will be
							protected from expiry.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Winning amounts advertised can vary from the actual
							amount received due to currency fluctuations, and
							the Player waives any claims for differences in
							winnings published and winnings received.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Any funds reflected in the Rewards Balance may only
							be used by the Player to purchase ticket entries in
							the lotteries and raffles offered by JollyLotto.
							Funds in the Rewards Balance may not be withdrawn
							and paid out of a Player's account.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Bank transfers and other alternative payment methods
							will only be credited to a Player's Account Balance

							Once a Player has successfully made a payment, we
							will securely register a reference to that payment
							and add it to the Registered Payment Methods list,
							which can be viewed or modified here at any time.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							Amounts which are deposited by the Player by credit
							card or other payment methods are credited to the
							Account Balance. Funds deposited into the Account
							Balance may not be withdrawn or transferred and can

							entries in the lotteries and raffles made available
							by JollyLotto.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							‘Subscription' is an entry method and recurring
							billing system that automatically enters the
							Player's ticket entries, based on either the renewal
							of a multi-draw entry once it has come to an end or
							a jackpot subscription where the minimum jackpot
							entry rule has been set by the Player. Subscription
							entries are confirmed by the Player selecting their
							entry particulars including the lottery entered and
							the numbers they want to be entered and will
							continue until such time as the Player logs into
							their account and changes the entry particulars of
							their subscription entry or pauses the subscription
							entry entirely.
						</p>
						<p className="text-[#24484B] text-lg mb-5">
							The Player acknowledges that ticket entries affected
