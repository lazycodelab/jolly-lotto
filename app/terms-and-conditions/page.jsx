								How Free Money becomes a real money
							</h2>
							<ol className="list-decimal text-[#24484B] text-lg ms-[4rem]">
								<li className="py-2">
									When you play a Casino game or wager on a
									sports event, a portion of your wager will
									be comprised of real money and a portion
									will be comprised of Free Money. All game
									payouts or sports bet payouts will be to
									your real money balance. In this fashion, as
									you wager on the site, your Free Money
									balance will reduce, and wins will payout
									into your real money balance.
								</li>
								<li className="py-2">
									Free money cannot be wagered on its own, it
									must be combined with real money to make
									your wager. Therefore, you cannot make a
									wager solely with Free Money, you will need
									real money in your account to utilize the
									free money.
								</li>
								<li className="py-2">
									Horse / Harness / Dog wagers made in the
									racebook do not utilize Free Money, and such
									wagers must be made with real money balance
									only.

							</h2>
							<ol className="list-decimal text-[#24484B] text-lg ms-[4rem]">
								<li className="py-2">
									The amount of Free Money used in the wager
									is determined by which game you are playing.
									For example, you can see in the list below
									that sports wagers use Free Money at a
									“39:1” rate. So, if you placed a $40 sports
									wager, $39 would come from your real money
									balance while the remaining $1 would come
									from your free money balance. Likewise, an
									$80 sports wager would use $2 from Free
									Money, and a $16.00 sports wager would use
									$0.40 of Free Money.
